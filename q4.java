//4. Music Playlist Organizer:

//o Create a class named Song with attributes for title, artist, genre, and duration (in
//seconds).

    }
    //maybe get funcs 

}


//o Design a class named MusicPlayer that maintains a playlist using an array of
//Song objects.

class MusicPlayer {

   //ï‚§ Print the playlist with song titles, artists, and durations. (Bonus: Simulate
   //basic playback using system commands if possible)
