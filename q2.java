    public Product ( String name , int price , int quantity ){
        this.name = name;

        this.quantity = quantity;

    }

//o Design a class named ShoppingCart that holds an array of Product objects
//representing a customer's cart.
class ShoppingCart{
    private Product [] cart ;

    //constructor
    public ShoppingCart (Product [] cart ){
        this.cart = cart;

        // maybe get
